# Multi Screen Config

Obviously, I have the primary screen (which btw is a touch screen) but I also have an external 1080p screen which is connected to the USBC port.
xrandr command outputs this in my case:

    eDP-1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 294mm x 165mm
		...
	DP-1 connected 1080x1920+1920+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 194mm
		...
	HDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
	DP-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
	HDMI-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
